# Universality of Real Minimal Complexity Reservoir

## Description
This repository contains the code for the illustrative examples in the paper [Universality of Real Minimal Complexity Reservoir].
This project uses QUBO solvers to solve Max-3-SAT problems.

The jupyter notebook Orthogonal_to_Cycle.ipynb demonstrates the the roots-of-unity competiton of cyclic dilation of orthogonal coupling described in Section 4 of the paper.

The jupyter notebook main_forecasting.ipynb contains the numerical experiments of the paper, where each aspect (state, output, forecasting performance etc) of randomly initiated linear reservoir systems are compared against it's dilated (orthogonal, cyclic) counterparts. 

## Data
The Electricity Transformer Dataset used in the experiments can be found in [ETDataset](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/ETDataset).
